# OSGi Examples

This project houses examples of OSGi applications in different open source OSGi containers.  The purpose is to try and get a clearer understanding of how
one would develop an OSGi application, and some live examples of the differences between some of the more popular open source OSGi containers.
<br/>

Once I have a better understanding of the OSGi specification, how OSGi applications are written, and how they differ from other applications (e.g. webapps),
I'll update this readme.
